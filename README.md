# Risk_Function
This repository contains data and files related to the risk function calculation based on the infromation from open crash databases (stats19, CRSS and ONISR) and scenario databases.
The intention of the project is to create a real-time risk level estimator for automated systems (e.g. autonomous vehicles).
Find more details on the use of Bayesian Networks for this purposes following this link https://ssrn.com/abstract=4329676
